# Game Engine

A small 3D game engine written in Rust!

This is a small game engine I am using as a way to learn more about, game engine architecture, rust, rendering, ECS and more.

:warning: If you are reading this, first of all thank you for checking out this repo, that's cool of you. But also, right now this repo is not functional and everything is WIP! :warning:

### Features
- An archetype based ECS system, and my attempt at implementing an API as ergonomic as Bevy's.
- A renderer that only renders the same triangle every time.
- WASM support.
