//! Hand-written FFI bindings to the Jolt Physics library.
//!
//! The C API is our own thin shim (headers and sources in `csrc/`) over the
//! unmodified Jolt sources at `vendor/JoltPhysics` — a git submodule pinned
//! to the upstream v5.0.0 release (MIT licensed, see
//! `vendor/JoltPhysics/LICENSE`). Run `git submodule update --init` after
//! cloning to fetch it. Everything — Jolt and the shim — is compiled by
//! `build.rs` in a single `cc` invocation, so there is no external binding
//! crate, no bindgen, and no CMake involved.
//!
//! The declarations below must mirror the `csrc` headers exactly.
