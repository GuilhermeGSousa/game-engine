//! Camera control as a stack.
//!
//! One [`MainCamera`] entity owns the window's render resources for the whole
//! run. Everything that wants to control the view spawns a [`VirtualCamera`] —
//! a pose with a priority — and the [`CameraDirector`] stacks them by priority.
//! Whatever is on top drives the main camera, blending on takeover.
//!
//! Having the component is being in the stack, and there is no way to
//! re-prioritise in place: a camera enters and leaves by the component being
//! added and removed. Whether an entry is *eligible* for control is the one
//! runtime toggle, and it lives on the director's stack entry rather than the
//! component, so flipping it takes effect immediately.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // A player rig: the pivot follows the character, the child is the pose.
//! cmd.spawn((CameraPivot::default(), Transform::default(), EntityFollow { .. }))
//!     .add_child((
//!         VirtualCamera::new(10),
//!         Transform::from_translation(Vec3::NEG_Z * 10.0),
//!     ));
//!
//! // A cutscene camera that ships with the scene, dormant until its cue.
//! let shot = cmd
//!     .spawn((VirtualCamera::new(100).disabled(), Transform::default()))
//!     .entity();
//!
//! director.set_enabled(shot, true);   // takes over
//! director.set_enabled(shot, false);  // hands control back
//! ```
